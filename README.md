# CodeAdventCalendar2023
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. I've chosen Python. 

All the puzzles take a specific input, which is given to the challengers in every puzzle, these inputs are processed by the algorithm you create to obtain the solution. These puzzles require a good level of programming and specially of problem solving. Very fun but some of them took me a fair amount of time to accomplish.  

Here are my solutions for several puzzles throughout the month, I did not get to solve them all before the 25th of december. I will definetly do better next year :)
