# CodeAdventCalendar2023
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. I've chosen Python. 

Here are my solutions for several puzzles, I did not get to solve them all before the 25th of december. Will do better next year :)
